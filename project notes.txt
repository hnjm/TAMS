1. Proposed system is expected to work on both ARM-based microcontrollers and computers.
2. The biometric verification will be multimodal
	i. Fingerprint verification
	ii. Facial verification
The administrator will elect the verification means for each instance of use. The 
system will default to fingerprint in absence of modification of system
settings by administrator .
3. To reduce latency, the system will be verification-based, the user's biometric data
will be compared to prior enrollment data.
4. The enrolment feature of the system should only be available to designated admins/staff
to ensure integrity of the system
5.

====================================================================================
To address:
1. The attendance devices should be stationary in a secure location at the venue of
use to reduce risk of damage/tampering/misuse
2. In the event of a usecase where a second event (lecture) is to begin immediately
at the end of another event (lecture) are students expected to repeat the verification
for the second lecture?
	> There could be a signout feature for students that are not to attend second event
	> What if there are a large number of students not slated to attend second event?
	> Is it the system's responsibility to police fraudulent signin (a student signing in 
	and leaving the venue)? - No
3. How would an admin/staff get access to the attendance at the end of the verification exercise
- will it be provided immediately by the system or will it be collated at the end of the semester,
or both?
