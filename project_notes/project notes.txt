1. Proposed system is expected to work on both ARM-based microcontrollers and computers.
2. The biometric verification will be multimodal
	i. Fingerprint verification
	ii. Facial verification
The administrator will elect the verification means for each instance of use. The 
system will default to facial recognition in absence of modification of system
settings by administrator .
3. To reduce latency, the system will be verification-based, the user's biometric data
will be compared to prior enrollment data.
4. The enrolment feature of the system should only be available to designated admins/staff
to ensure integrity of the system
5.

====================================================================================
To address:
1. The attendance devices should be stationary in a secure location at the venue of
use to reduce risk of damage/tampering/misuse
2. In the event of a usecase where a second event (lecture) is to begin immediately
at the end of another event (lecture) are students expected to repeat the verification
for the second lecture?
	>There should be a feature for an admin to void a particular student's attendance 
		(if a student is asked to leave)
	> There could be a signout feature for students that are not to attend second event
	> What if there are a large number of students not slated to attend second event?
	> Is it the system's responsibility to police fraudulent signin (a student signing in 
	and leaving the venue)? - No
3. How would an admin/staff get access to the attendance at the end of the verification exercise
- will it be provided immediately by the system or will it be collated at the end of the semester,
or both?

======================================================================================
There should be two separate interfaces:
	1.	The attendance interface: where student attendance can be taken
		- the attendance interface should have a means for setting course, and whether the 
			attendance is for a clecture or an exam (this should be the responsibility of either
			the class rep or the lecturer)
		- students should only be required to provide their registration number and biometric info.
	2. The admin interface:
		-	where students could be enrolled - (accessible to only group of admins)
		-	where new courses could be added to the system (accessible to only a group of admins)
		-	where attendance records could be accessed (all admins)
		-	

=======================================================================================
defining groups of admins and privileges

1.	superusers:
	- can facilitate student initial enrolment and updates
	- can add/edit new courses to the database of courses available
	- can access all attendance records on the system

2.	examofficers:
	- can add new courses to the database of courses available
	- can download attendance records for their department

3.	lecturer:
	###- could delegate a student_rep to setup a session of attendance-taking
	- can download attendance records for their course
	- can setup/initialize a session of attendance-taking

4.	student_rep:
	- can setup/initialize a session of attendance-taking

5.	student:
	- can provide registration id and biometric info for attendance-taking in a valid
		attendance-taking session

======================================================================================
breaking down the student enrollment process:
1.	Students are expected to provide their:
	- registration id
	- name (first name, last name, other names)
	- department
	- faculty
	- level of study
	- biometric details (fingerprint, photo)
	- department, (faculty), (school?)

=======================================================================================
Department/Faculty Information:
- There should be an interface to easily upload these details to the system in bulk and
	also add a single new department/faculty 

=======================================================================================
***Improving strictness in marking
- The admin could set the start time and end time of lecture/event and every attendance
	outside the specified time range will be voided or flagged and proveded to the lecturer
	to handle (to avoid cases where such occurences were permitted by the lecturer)

=======================================================================================
***What happens when the device turns off and comes back on during an attendance-taking 
	session
=======================================================================================
