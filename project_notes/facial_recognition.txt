Student verification should be based on identification (i.e. 1:1)
    -this has the advantage of reducing latency

===============================================================================
For another usecase like normal invigilation:
    There may be need to perform identification (i.e. N:1).
    In this scenario, there would be need to conduct the search as optimally as 
    possible. Could begin by checking:
    -All registered students for a particular level/class
    -All other registered students of the department
    -All registered students of the faculty
    -All students of the school


    -If a student is not registered in a department, he should not be present in a
    departmental lecture/exam??
    -If a student is not registered in a faculty, he should not be present in a 
    faculty lecture/exam??
    -Some  departments borrow departmental courses <<
