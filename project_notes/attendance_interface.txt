=====   THE ATTENDANCE INTERFACE    ====
Detailed specifications concerning the attendance interface of the system

1. The attendance interface is expected to work on both ARM-based microcontrollers and computers
2. The biometric verification will be multimodal 
    i. Fingerprint verification
    ii. Facial verification
    ***It is expected that only one mode be used for a particular attendance-taking session
    ***The system will default to fingerprint IF A FINGERPRINT SENSOR is present and in absence
        of the admin/convener explicitly opting for facial mode.

3. To reduce latency, the system will be verification-based, the user's biometric data
    will be compared to prior enrollment data.
4. The enrolment feature of the system should only be available to designated staff/admins
    to ensure integrity of the system.


=============================   SPECIFICATIONS  ================================
Details of how the attendance interface should function normally

1.  The host device should power up and load the attendance interface
    (Unauthorized closure of interface should be minimized)
        - what will happen in the event of unresponsive interface?
2.  Only a staff/student with authorization (class rep?) should be able to initialize an 
    attendance-taking session. To be able to initialize an attendance-taking session,
    the initiator must specify the following information
        - the course (selected from a list)
        - Exam/Lecture (could be a dropdown list)
        - Start time and end time of event (Display device date/time setting with option for 
                                    admin/user to adjust it)
        - The mode of verification (fingerprint/face) - default to fingerprint if
            the device is fit to handle both modes
3. The attendance-taking session:
    There should be a button that can end attendance-taking session at anytime
    (will require an authorized admin to end session)
    For a student to log his attendance for lecture/exam:
        - He will input his registration number -with QR code or by typing 
            (preferably QR)
        - If his records are not found in the system, inform him. system
            moves back to waiting for another student reg. number
        -if his records are found, collect fingerprint/picture of face  
            and compare with saved template/face encodings
        -if no match provide him with the option to re-try one more time or accept
            the error message to continue to the next student. Can not re-try more than twice
        -if there is match print success message and request next student reg. number
        -continue until session is ended/**suspended



==============  SUGGESTIONS     ========================
1. The devices running the attendance interfaces could be kept stationary in a secure
    location at the venue of use to reduce risk of damage/tampering/misuse

2. 

============ Questions  ====================================
1. How wiould an admin/staff get access to the attendance at the end of an
    attendance-taking session? Could it be provided by the system?
